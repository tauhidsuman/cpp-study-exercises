# cpp-study-exercises
All the source code in this repository was developed for purposes of studying and exercising my C++ skills. It covers topics such as: arrays, strings, scalability, math, probability, recursion, dynamic programming, object orientation, and data structures in general (stack, queue, tree, graph, list, hash table etc.). Exercises were taken from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview (5th Edition)". Please feel free to use this a reference or copy any code to your convenience. Please keep in mind
this project is not maintained often.

This was developed using Visual Studio 2013, and each folder contains a project referring to a chapter of the book. Loading the .sln should be enough to organize the project tree. If you are not a VS user, each main file should run without problems. The number suffix on each main file represents the chapter of the book it is related to. For ex.: 'main7.cpp' refers will run the exercises for the seventh chapter 'Math and Probability'.
